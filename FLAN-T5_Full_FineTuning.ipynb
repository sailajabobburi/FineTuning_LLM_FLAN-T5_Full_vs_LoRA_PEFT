    "## Full Fine-Tuning of FLAN-T5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Previously, we explored zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques in [Zero_Multishot_Inference.ipynb](./Zero_Multishot_Inference.ipynb).  \n",
    "These approaches demonstrated how well FLAN-T5 can generate responses with pretrained knowledge and in-context learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we move to full fine-tuning, where we train FLAN-T5 on a specific dataset to improve performance for a targeted task.  \n",
    "Fine-tuning allows the model to:\n",
    "- Learn task-specific patterns beyond its pretraining.\n",
    "- Generalize better within the domain.\n",
    "- Perform more consistently without needing complex prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers:\n",
    "- Preparing the dataset  \n",
    "- Setting up the fine-tuning pipeline  \n",
    "- Training FLAN-T5 from its pretrained state  \n",
    "- Evaluating and saving the fine-tuned model  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin.\n"
